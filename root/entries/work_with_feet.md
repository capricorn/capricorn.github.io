# Working With Your Feet

_Faced with a scholarly book._---We do not belong to those
who have ideas only among books, when stimulated by books.
It is our habit to think outdoors---walking, leaping, climbing,
dancing, preferably on lonely mountains or near the sea where
even the trails become thoughtful. Our first questions about the
value of a book, of a human being, or a musical composition
are: Can they walk? Even more, can they dance?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We read rarely, but not worse on that account. How quickly
we guess how someone has come by his ideas; whether it was
while sitting in front of his inkwell, with a pinched belly, his
head bowed low over the paper---in which case we are quickly
finished with his book, too! Cramped intestines betray themselves---you can bet on that---no less than closet air, closet ceilings, closet narrowness.---This was what I felt just now as I
closed a very decent scholarly book---gratefully, very gratefully,
but also with a sense of relief.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost always the books of scholars are somehow oppressive,
oppressed; the "specialist" emerges somewhere---his zeal, his
seriousness, his fury, his overestimation of the nook in which
he sits and spins, his hunched back; every specialist has his
hunched back. Every scholarly book also mirrors a soul that has
become crooked; every craft makes crooked.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see the friends of your youth again after they have taken
possession of their specialty---and always the opposite has happened, too! Always they themselves are now possessed by it and obsessed with it. Grown into their nook, crumpled beyond recognition, unfree, deprived of their balance, emaciated and angular all over except for one place where they are downright
rotund---one feels moved and falls silent when one sees them again this way. Every craft, even if it should have a golden floor, has a leaden ceiling over it that presses and presses down
upon the soul until that becomes queer and crooked. Nothing
can be done about that. Let nobody suppose that one could possibly avoid such crippling by some artifice of education. On this earth one pays dearly for every kind of _mastery_, and perhaps
one pays too dearly for everything. For having a specialty one
pays by also being the victim of this specialty. But you would
have it otherwise---cheaper and fairer and above all more comfortable---isn't that right, my dear contemporaries? Well then,
but in that case you also immediately get something else: instead of the craftsman and master, the "man of letters," the
dexterous, "polydexterous" man of letters who, to be sure,
lacks the hunched back---not counting the posture he assumes
before you, being the salesman of the spirit and the "carrier"
of culture---the man of letters who really _is_ nothing but "represents" almost everything, playing and "substituting" for the
expert, and taking it upon himself in all modesty to get himself
paid, honored, and celebrated in place of the expert.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, my scholarly friends, I bless you even for your hunched
backs. And for despising, as I do, the "men of letters" and culture parasites. 
And for not knowing how to make a business of
the spirit. And for having opinions that cannot be translated
into financial values. And for not representing anything that
you are not. And because your sole aim is to become masters of
your craft, with reverence for every kind of mastery and competence, and with uncompromising opposition to everything that
is semblance, half-genuine, dressed up, virtuosolike, demagogical. or histrionic in _litteris et artibus_---to everything that cannot prove to you its unconditional _probity_ in discipline and
prior training.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Even genius does not compensate for such a deficiency, however much it may deceive people about it. This becomes clear
to anyone who has ever watched our most gifted painters and
musicians from nearby. All of them, with scarcely any exception, know how to use cunning inventions of manners, of makeshift devices, and even of principles to give themselves after the
event an artificial semblance of such probity, of such solidity of
training and culture---without, of course, managing to deceive themselves,
without silencing for good their own bad conscience. For you surely know that all great modern artists suffer from a guilty conscience.)
