# Retire at 62?

Social Security in the United States allows for an individual to 'retire early' in exchange for a reduced benefit.
For the 1960 and later cohort, taking the earliest retirement at age 62 results in a 30% reduction of the benefit received:

This raises the question: if a retiree waits til 67 to receive their full benefit annually, how many years will it take for
their total benefit earnings to surpass that of the 62 year old? My assumptions are:

- Both retirees collect equal annual benefits
- Once a benefit is taken it is fixed, i.e. the 62 year old is stuck with a 70% benefit and the 67 year old with a 100% benefit.

Take the two retirees, '62' and '67.' 62 has a head start of five years of earnings by the time he reaches 67. Therefore,
the earnings $t$ years after 67 of both individuals converges at:

$$
(0.7)(t+5) = 1t
$$

Solving the above equation results in $t=11\frac{2}{3}$. 67 must effectively live 12 more years to the age of 79 to 'outearn' 62 in
benefits. Is this a good deal? At least with respect to men, the [average life expectancy in the United States is 74.8 years (CDC).](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm)
In that case if 67 and 62 both die at 75 years old, 67 loses not once, but twice: he enjoys five fewer years of retirement and also collects fewer total benefits.
