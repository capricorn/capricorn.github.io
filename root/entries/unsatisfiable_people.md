# A Satisfiability Problem

There exists a kind of person that will always have a problem. How?
First, take this individual, wave a magic wand and solve all of their problems. 
Their worries: gone. But the happiness is fleeting. Time passes but seemingly
begins to slow; soon enough the idleness is unbearable.

The problem paradox: the problem is that they don't have a problem.

Such a person must always have a problem. Clearly they do if they have a problem.
And if they don't, then that too is a problem.
