<h1 id="working-with-your-feet">Working With Your Feet</h1>
<p><em>Faced with a scholarly book.</em>—We do not belong to those who
have ideas only among books, when stimulated by books. It is our habit
to think outdoors—walking, leaping, climbing, dancing, preferably on
lonely mountains or near the sea where even the trails become
thoughtful. Our first questions about the value of a book, of a human
being, or a musical composition are: Can they walk? Even more, can they
dance?<br />
    We read rarely, but not worse on that account. How quickly we guess
how someone has come by his ideas; whether it was while sitting in front
of his inkwell, with a pinched belly, his head bowed low over the
paper—in which case we are quickly finished with his book, too! Cramped
intestines betray themselves—you can bet on that—no less than closet
air, closet ceilings, closet narrowness.—This was what I felt just now
as I closed a very decent scholarly book—gratefully, very gratefully,
but also with a sense of relief.<br />
    Almost always the books of scholars are somehow oppressive,
oppressed; the “specialist” emerges somewhere—his zeal, his seriousness,
his fury, his overestimation of the nook in which he sits and spins, his
hunched back; every specialist has his hunched back. Every scholarly
book also mirrors a soul that has become crooked; every craft makes
crooked.<br />
    You see the friends of your youth again after they have taken
possession of their specialty—and always the opposite has happened, too!
Always they themselves are now possessed by it and obsessed with it.
Grown into their nook, crumpled beyond recognition, unfree, deprived of
their balance, emaciated and angular all over except for one place where
they are downright rotund—one feels moved and falls silent when one sees
them again this way. Every craft, even if it should have a golden floor,
has a leaden ceiling over it that presses and presses down upon the soul
until that becomes queer and crooked. Nothing can be done about that.
Let nobody suppose that one could possibly avoid such crippling by some
artifice of education. On this earth one pays dearly for every kind of
<em>mastery</em>, and perhaps one pays too dearly for everything. For
having a specialty one pays by also being the victim of this specialty.
But you would have it otherwise—cheaper and fairer and above all more
comfortable—isn’t that right, my dear contemporaries? Well then, but in
that case you also immediately get something else: instead of the
craftsman and master, the “man of letters,” the dexterous,
“polydexterous” man of letters who, to be sure, lacks the hunched
back—not counting the posture he assumes before you, being the salesman
of the spirit and the “carrier” of culture—the man of letters who really
<em>is</em> nothing but “represents” almost everything, playing and
“substituting” for the expert, and taking it upon himself in all modesty
to get himself paid, honored, and celebrated in place of the
expert.<br />
    No, my scholarly friends, I bless you even for your hunched backs.
And for despising, as I do, the “men of letters” and culture parasites.
And for not knowing how to make a business of the spirit. And for having
opinions that cannot be translated into financial values. And for not
representing anything that you are not. And because your sole aim is to
become masters of your craft, with reverence for every kind of mastery
and competence, and with uncompromising opposition to everything that is
semblance, half-genuine, dressed up, virtuosolike, demagogical. or
histrionic in <em>litteris et artibus</em>—to everything that cannot
prove to you its unconditional <em>probity</em> in discipline and prior
training.<br />
    (Even genius does not compensate for such a deficiency, however much
it may deceive people about it. This becomes clear to anyone who has
ever watched our most gifted painters and musicians from nearby. All of
them, with scarcely any exception, know how to use cunning inventions of
manners, of makeshift devices, and even of principles to give themselves
after the event an artificial semblance of such probity, of such
solidity of training and culture—without, of course, managing to deceive
themselves, without silencing for good their own bad conscience. For you
surely know that all great modern artists suffer from a guilty
conscience.)</p>
