<h1 id="computer-science">“Computer Science”</h1>
<p>Peter Thiel is fond of claiming, <a
href="https://youtu.be/VCYo8ryG-ns?t=21">“when people use [the term]
science, it’s a tell that something isn’t a science–like political
science or climate science or computer science…”</a></p>
<p>Others have dug into the etymology of our dear field… perhaps out of
a morbid fascination? That devilish Dutchman Dijkstra in <a
href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD09xx/EWD924.html">EWD
924</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usually these [Departments of Computer Science] were little more than
ill-considered cocktails of locally available disciplines (and
semi-disciplines) that had some connection with automatic computing:
electronic engineering, communication and switching theory, business
administration, numerical analysis, numerical control, library science,
artificial intelligence and the like, in short, such an incoherent bunch
of disciplines that the resulting cocktail hardly appealed to the
intellectually discerning palate. These premature departments were
concerned with construction of the various possible application areas of
computers…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so Dijkstra argues for (and stubbornly uses) a slightly different
name for the field, <em>Computing</em> Science:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This discipline, which became known as Computing Science, emerged
only when people started to look for what be common to the use of any
computer in any application. By this abstraction, computing science
immediately and clearly divorced itself from electronic engineering:
<strong>the computing scientist could not care less about the specific
technology that might be used to realize machines, be it electronics,
optics, pneumatics, or magic</strong>. At the same stroke, computing
science separated itself from all the specific problems of embedding
computers meaningfully in some segment of some society —concerns that,
societies being as different as they are, are almost unavoidably
parochial—.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Dijkstra is not alone; Hal Abelson in his <a
href="https://youtu.be/2Op3QLzMgSY?list=PLB745DA2483BEE9C4&amp;t=27">first
of the famous SICP lectures</a> begins the series with the proclamation
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Computer science is a terrible name for this business. First of all,
it’s not a science.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, it seems to be more alchemical than scientific:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… [computer science] actually has a lot in common with magic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to his why, well, you’ll just have to watch his lectures… Going
further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s also not really very much about computers. And it’s not about
computers in the sense that physics is not really about particle
accelerators, and biology is not really about microscopes and petri
dishes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dijkstra also happens to use a similar analogy; mentioned first in <a
href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/MemRes(A4).pdf">a memorium</a> for
him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about
telescopes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and <a
href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/commemoration/EWD-commemoration-2021.pdf">a
commemoration</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, he objected even to the term “Computer Science”. He likened
this to naming Astronomy as “Telescope Science”, defining a science by
its instruments rather than by the area of its search for truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so to respond to Thiel, unlike the other two maligned fields,
perhaps this is just an error in naming? At least for the time being?
After all, that is <a
href="https://www.karlton.org/2017/12/naming-things-hard/">one of the
two hard things in Computer Science.</a></p>
